A set of scripts to extract Swift-BAT detector rates and BAT coded FOV for a particular time. 
Scripts depends on https://github.com/lanl/swiftbat_python

To use get_swift_obsid.py edit config.yaml.
Each script may be used separetely.


I thank David Plamer and Aaron Tohuvavohu for the comments that help to create these scripts.
